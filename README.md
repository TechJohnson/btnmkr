# btnmkr
An easy-to-use button maker for all web developers.

I created this project in 2018 to learn a bit of React. The whole purpose of this project was to create a simple website where a front-end developer can create a button using a GUI and the code is instantly spit out for the user to copy & paste.

The site is no longer active, but the code is still available for everyone to see how we did it. I had my buddy help lead me in the right directions so I didn't make any silly mistakes.

Great learning experience!
